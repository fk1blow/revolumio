## disclaimer

I can only imagine how much time and effort went into building(and maintaining) this whole suite
of apps, so take this as an UI/UX exercise rather than a review or critique!

## why

Maybe that's just me(TM), but the original Volumio UI has some serious UX issues.
Right fromo the get-go, i was pretty sure that i can mute or modify the player status,
just by hitting some keys on my keyboard.
Arrow up/down to adjust the volume, or hitting the "space" bar to mute the whole thing...
It doesn't work!

What it want(that's too harsh, so let's say "what i expect") from a player, is to
work... like other players work.
Most of these habit were built over time....
